## wavelets.py

This file is used to save wavelet functions. In my respository, the real part of Shannon Wavelet is used as an example. It can be used because real part of Shannon Wavelets are orthogonal[1]. According to [Wikipedia of Shannon Wavelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_wavelet), the expression of the real part of Shannon Wavelets can be written as:

$Psi^{(Sha)}(t)$
